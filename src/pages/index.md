Currently an experiment,  
for web prose,  
with decent typography,  
and hardcore responsiveness.

---

This very page is presented in the usual prose book style. 

> And very very few places have ever been as comfortable as a book in hand.

## Examples

- [Books](/books/)
  - [Moby Dick](/books/moby-dick/)


## Angst

Text content online looks like ass. Responsiveness is a joke. Compromises are abundant. The defaults are unreadable on screens larger than 720p.

Perhaps we may have to compromise the complexity of our styles. But we gain such great usability.

## Layout

The cover is the start of the layout. The page is 50 characters wide in content, and the border divides the remaining space equally.

And then comes the text.

Things are comfortably spaced, and then some. The responsiveness does not stop at large laptop screens.

## Typography

The text is at max 50 characters large. It scales from 16px to 20px base font size and scales in font-scale from 1.2 to 1.25.

Paragraphs have a slight indent. I find it comfortable.

[Libre Baskerville](https://github.com/impallari/Libre-Baskerville) adorns the text. 

## Colors

Are there any? Perhaps an accent or two.
